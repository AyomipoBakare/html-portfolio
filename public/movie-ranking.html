<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>Hackshaw Ridge</h3>
<p>The true story of Pfc. Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who won the Congressional Medal of Honor despite refusing
    to
    bear arms during WWII on religious grounds. Doss was drafted and ostracized by fellow soldiers for his pacifist
    stance
    but went on to earn respect and adoration for his bravery, selflessness and compassion after he risked his life --
    without firing a shot -- to save 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa. <br> <br>
    It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.

<h3>The Hangover (Series)</h3>
<p>The Hangover" is a funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny. Most of
    the
    dialogue is funny. <br> <br>
    The Hangover is an outrageous comedy with non-stop laughs.. its three parts are equally Wild and crazy. </p>
<h4>Release date: 2 June 2009 (USA)</h4>
<h4>Director: Todd Phillips</h4>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life
    imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner. <br> <br>
    This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming
    all at the same time. I get chills every time</p>
